This project contains answers to the exercises given in the "Kodeoppgave - Xledger Labs AS.doc".

The exercises are done by Kristian Pedersen for Xledger.

I chose to use english as the coding- and documentation language. I did this because I assume it is the standard within Xledger. 
I also chose to keep the number of code files to two for each exercise. One for tests and one for the solution.
The solutions can be found in src/exercises and the tests can be found in src/tests.

Oppgave 1 is solved by DuplicateRemover.cs
Oppgave 2 is solved by AtomCounter.cs
Oppgave 3 is solved by ReversePolishParser.cs
Oppgave 4 is solved by BaseEncoder.cs
Oppgave 5 is solved by Differentiator.cs
The tests are named on the form [SolutionName]Tester.cs and done with xUnit
